# MATLAB-Equations-of-motion

This is a matlab script that simulates the dynamics of an Underwater glider in three-dimensional space. The equations of motion are numerically solved using the ODE45 (Runge Kutta) matlab solver.
The main goal of the script is to simulate a steady spiral motion. The parameters used in the script is taken from [Spiraling motion of underwater gliders: Modeling, analysis, and experimental results](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/256817942_Spiraling_motion_of_underwater_gliders_Modeling_analysis_and_experimental_results)
