# MATLAB simulation:  Simulation of an underwater glider in 3D space

This is a matlab script that simulates the dynamics of an underwater glider in three-dimensional space. The equations of motion are numerically solved using the ODE45 Matlab solver.

 The dynamic model and the hydrodynamic coefficients is based on the Seawing glider presented in [Zhang et al.](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/256817942_Spiraling_motion_of_underwater_gliders_Modeling_analysis_and_experimental_results). There are developed two different 6DOF dynamic models for the underwater glider. The Vectorial model is the universal Fossens 6DOF marine craft model presented in  [Handbook of Marine Craft Hydrodynamics and Motion Control](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/book/10.1002/9781119994138). The Hamiltonian model is developed based on the work presented in  [Zhang et al.](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/256817942_Spiraling_motion_of_underwater_gliders_Modeling_analysis_and_experimental_results). Both models simulates the dynamics of an underwater glider with internal cylindrycal actuators.
