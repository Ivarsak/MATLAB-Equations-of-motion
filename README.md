# MATLAB-Equations-of-motion

This is a matlab script that simulates the dynamics of an underwater glider in three-dimensional space. The equations of motion are numerically solved using the ODE45 (Runge Kutta) matlab solver.
The main goal of the script is to simulate a steady spiral motion.
 The glider model and mechanical parameters used in the script is taken from the Seawing glider:
