# MATLAB-Equations-of-motion

This is a matlab script that simulates the dynamics of an underwater glider in three-dimensional space. The equations of motion are numerically solved using the ODE45 (Runge Kutta) matlab solver.
The main goal of the script is to simulate a steady spiral motion.
 The dynamic model and hydrodynamic coefficients is based on the Seawing glider presented in [Zhang et al.](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/256817942_Spiraling_motion_of_underwater_gliders_Modeling_analysis_and_experimental_results) 
The paper also presents an analytical approach to the spiraling equilibria soultions.
